## Third party libraries

When including third party libraries, write a short explanation in the README why the library is used and how it benefits the application.

1. node-cron : This helps create a sync/cron job that syncs the product file with Sitoo every x seconds.
2. axios

## Dummie Note: 

1. I named the directory folder as 'sync' isntead of 'services' thinking it is more straightforward in terms of features but I could be tottally inappropriate.
